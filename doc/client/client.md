# witica.js (client library)

The Witica client library (witica.js) gives you access to the items in a *WebTarget*, when writing the renderers to display the content. Below you find a documentation for all the classes/functions you can use. witica.js defines two namespaces:

* `Witica`: for the core functionality to access metadata and content and
* `Witica.util`: generic algorithms that provide for example common functions that can be used when writing renderers to display/format information.

## Witica

* [Witica.Item](!doc/client/witica_item) (accessing metadata and content from a *WebTarget*)
* [Witica.View](!doc/client/witica_view) (page area that can display content)
* [Witica.Renderer](!doc/client/witica_renderer) (render item metadata and content)

## Witica.util
